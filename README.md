## HOW TO USE THIS DOCUMENT 

**IMPORTANT: This file contains instructions and context for AI to work on the website. It must always be taken into account when making changes or additions to the codebase.**

**DEVELOPMENT RULE: All phases must use numbered tasks (e.g., 4.1, 4.2, etc.) and each task must produce specific and measurable changes so we can track progress effectively.**

AI AGENTS ARE NEVER running install or builld commands by themselves. Always ask the user to run the commands when needed. 

This README serves as the primary reference for understanding the project structure, deployment process, and development roadmap. All AI assistants should consult this document before making modifications.

## Project Description

This is our complete business agency website built on the [BlackSpike Astro Landing Page theme](https://astro.build/themes/details/blackspike-astro-landing-page/). We've customized it for Frontier Agency's specific business needs while maintaining the modern design and performance optimizations of the original theme, and enhanced it with comprehensive features for a professional agency presence.

## Challenges & Solutions

### Render-Blocking CSS Performance Issue ‚ùå **NOT SOLVED**

**Problem**: Google PageSpeed Insights reports render-blocking CSS requests causing 430ms delays in page rendering, affecting Core Web Vitals scores.

**Attempted Solution**: Implemented critical CSS inlining and async CSS loading strategy, but this broke the website layout:
- Menu disappeared
- Hero section split into multiple blocks
- Products section layout changed
- Overall design was compromised

**Current Status**: All performance optimization changes have been reverted to restore website functionality. The render-blocking CSS issue remains unsolved.

**Next Steps**: Need to find an alternative approach to CSS optimization that doesn't interfere with the existing BlackSpike theme layout and styling.

### Language Switcher Functionality Challenge ‚ùå **NOT SOLVED**

**Problem**: Language switcher component only works correctly on the homepage. Users cannot switch languages from other pages (blog posts, archive pages, etc.), forcing them to return to the homepage to change languages.

**Root Cause**: The current `LanguageSwitcher.astro` component has limited logic that only handles basic page types and doesn't properly handle:
- Individual blog post translations using `enSlug`/`esSlug` fields
- Complex URL structures for different page types
- Navigation menu language-aware URL generation
- Internal link translation throughout the site

**Current Implementation Issues**:
- Language switcher logic is too simplistic for complex routing
- No fallback handling when translations are not available
- Missing support for dynamic content (blog posts, search results, pagination)
- Navigation links don't respect current language context

**Impact**: 
- Poor user experience - users must navigate back to homepage to change language
- Broken multilingual functionality - core feature not working as expected
- SEO issues - language-specific URLs not properly linked

**Solution Strategy**: Implement comprehensive Phase 2.1 tasks to create a robust language switching system that works across all page types and content.

### Netlify Forms Integration Challenge

During Phase 3 implementation, we encountered a significant challenge with Netlify Forms integration. The original form implementation wasn't being detected by Netlify's form processing system, preventing form submissions from being processed correctly.

#### The Problem
- Netlify Forms requires specific HTML structure and attributes to auto-detect forms
- Our dynamic modal-based form wasn't being recognized by Netlify's build-time form detection
- Form submissions were failing silently without proper error handling
- The multilingual form implementation added complexity to the detection process

#### The Solution
We implemented a comprehensive solution using a **dual-form approach**:

1. **Hidden Static Form**: Added a hidden form with `data-netlify="true"` attribute that Netlify can detect during build time
2. **Dynamic Modal Form**: Enhanced the existing `DialogModal.astro` component with proper Netlify attributes
3. **Form Synchronization**: Implemented JavaScript to sync data between the hidden and visible forms
4. **Multilingual Support**: Added language-specific form handling and validation messages

#### Technical Implementation Details

**Hidden Form Structure:**
```html
<form name="contact" data-netlify="true" data-netlify-honeypot="bot-field" hidden>
  <input type="text" name="name" />
  <input type="email" name="email" />
  <textarea name="message"></textarea>
  <input type="text" name="bot-field" />
</form>
```

**Dynamic Form Enhancement:**
- Added `data-netlify="true"` and `data-netlify-honeypot="bot-field"` attributes
- Implemented proper form action and method attributes
- Added honeypot field for spam protection
- Enhanced accessibility with proper ARIA labels and focus management

**Form Synchronization:**
- JavaScript function to copy data from modal form to hidden form before submission
- Proper error handling and user feedback
- Multilingual success/error messages
- Form validation with localized error messages

#### Results
- ‚úÖ Netlify Forms now properly detects and processes form submissions
- ‚úÖ Email notifications configured and working
- ‚úÖ Spam protection via honeypot field
- ‚úÖ Multilingual form support (English/Spanish)
- ‚úÖ Proper accessibility and user experience
- ‚úÖ Form validation with localized error messages

This solution ensures reliable form processing while maintaining the modern, dynamic user experience of our modal-based contact form.

### Blog Post Content Formatting Challenge

During Phase 4 implementation, we encountered significant challenges with blog post content formatting that required multiple iterations to resolve properly.

#### The Problem
- **Poor Code Block Contrast**: Code blocks were displaying with dark text on dark backgrounds, making them completely unreadable
- **Missing Visual Hierarchy**: Headings lacked proper contrast and spacing, making content difficult to scan
- **Inconsistent Typography**: Text colors and spacing were inconsistent across different content elements
- **Missing List Bullets**: Unordered and ordered lists were displaying without bullet points or numbers
- **CSS Specificity Issues**: Theme styles were overriding our custom prose styles due to CSS specificity conflicts

#### The Solution
We implemented a comprehensive solution using **high-specificity CSS selectors** and **global styling**:

1. **Changed Class Names**: Replaced `prose-content` with `post-content` to avoid conflicts
2. **Added Global Styles**: Used `is:global` attribute to ensure styles apply correctly
3. **High Specificity Selectors**: Used `article .post-content` with `!important` flags to override theme styles
4. **Fixed Code Block Contrast**: 
   - Background: `#1f2937` (dark gray)
   - Text: `#f8fafc` (bright white)
   - Added `article .post-content pre * { color: #f8fafc !important; }` to force all code text to be white
5. **Restored List Styling**: 
   - Added `list-style: revert !important;` to restore default list styling
   - Explicitly set `list-style-type: disc` for unordered lists and `decimal` for ordered lists
   - Styled markers with `color: #9ca3af` for professional appearance

#### Technical Implementation Details

**CSS Structure:**
```css
<style is:global>
  article .post-content {
    font-family: var(--font-body);
    color: #e5e7eb !important;
    line-height: 1.8 !important;
    font-size: 1.125rem !important;
  }
  
  article .post-content h1 {
    font-size: 2.5rem !important;
    color: #ffffff !important;
    font-weight: 700 !important;
  }
  
  article .post-content pre {
    background-color: #1f2937 !important;
    color: #f8fafc !important;
  }
  
  article .post-content ul {
    list-style-type: disc !important;
  }
</style>
```

**Key Features:**
- ‚úÖ **Professional Typography**: Clear heading hierarchy with proper font weights and colors
- ‚úÖ **Readable Code Blocks**: High contrast with proper syntax highlighting support
- ‚úÖ **Visible List Markers**: Bullets and numbers properly displayed
- ‚úÖ **Consistent Spacing**: Proper margins and padding throughout content
- ‚úÖ **Theme Integration**: All styling uses theme color variables and fonts

#### Results
- ‚úÖ Blog posts now display with **magazine-quality typography**
- ‚úÖ Code blocks are **highly readable** with excellent contrast
- ‚úÖ Lists display **proper bullets and numbers**
- ‚úÖ Content maintains **visual hierarchy** and professional appearance
- ‚úÖ **Consistent styling** across both English and Spanish versions

This solution ensures that blog content is not only functional but also visually appealing and professional, matching the high-quality standards of the BlackSpike theme.
