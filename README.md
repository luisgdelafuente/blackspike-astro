A complete, best-in-class Astro website for a business agency with all the features needed to present the company, offerings, news, git-hosted images, ultra-optimized for SEO, and more.

## HOW TO USE THIS DOCUMENT 

**IMPORTANT: This file contains instructions and context for AI to work on the website. It must always be taken into account when making changes or additions to the codebase.**

**DEVELOPMENT RULE: All phases must use numbered tasks (e.g., 4.1, 4.2, etc.) and each task must produce specific and measurable changes so we can track progress effectively.**

AI AGENTS ARE NEVER running install or builld commands by themselves. Always ask the user to run the commands when needed. 

This README serves as the primary reference for understanding the project structure, deployment process, and development roadmap. All AI assistants should consult this document before making modifications.

## Project Description

This is our complete business agency website built on the [BlackSpike Astro Landing Page theme](https://astro.build/themes/details/blackspike-astro-landing-page/). We've customized it for Frontier Agency's specific business needs while maintaining the modern design and performance optimizations of the original theme, and enhanced it with comprehensive features for a professional agency presence.
